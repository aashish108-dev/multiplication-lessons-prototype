# Multiples of Numbers

## Getting up and running

### Requirements


* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Installing node.js will also install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) for us too. We'll need it for dependencies and some scripts.

### Dependencies

`$ npm install`

### Run

`$ npm start`

### Development

### Test

You can run the tests. Only one included so far.

`$ npm test`

## The exercise

__Goal__: Help a child understand multiplication!

__Description__: Click a number to show all numbers that are its multiples. Also used as a test-bed for some simple Mocha/Chai tests that I'm playing around with.
